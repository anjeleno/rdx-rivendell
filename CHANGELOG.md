## v3.4.14 (2025-10-24)
### UI
- Jack Graph: Added drag-to-connect cables with live preview; connect on drop from outputs to inputs and cancel on outside drop.
- Jack Graph: Right-click cable menu refined with Lock/Unlock state and Disconnect disabled for locked pairs.
- Profiles: Added Edit‚Ä¶ dialog to modify saved profiles (add/remove pairs) and save.
- Visibility: Thicker, higher-contrast cables and reliable rendering across environments.

### Fixed
- `jack_lsp -c` parsing tolerates any whitespace; existing connections now render consistently.
- Version strings aligned across header, window title, status bar, and application metadata.

### Packaging
- Bumped package to 3.4.14 and rebuilt `.deb`.

## v3.4.13 (2025-10-24)
### Fixed
- Profile generator now chooses true stereo pairs for each client (e.g., fm_l/fm_r, in_0/in_1) instead of occasionally picking two left channels (like fm_l + low_l).
- JACK connect: treat non-fatal "Cannot lock down ... memory area" messages as noise; verify actual connection state and proceed to avoid false failures.
- Applying a generated profile is now best-effort: each connect is attempted independently so a single transient warning won‚Äôt abort the whole apply. A concise summary is shown if any non-fatal issues occurred.

### UI
- Jack Graph: Lines (cables) are now more visible, and existing connections reliably render by tolerating any whitespace in `jack_lsp -c` output. This fixes the "only dots, no cables" issue on some systems.


### Packaging
- Prepared 3.4.13 with the above fixes.

## v3.4.12 (2025-10-24)
### Fixed
- Hotfix: Restored Jack Graph tab. An internal reference to a removed method during initialization caused a silent exception and the tab didn‚Äôt appear. The call is now removed.

### Packaging
- Rebuilt `.deb` as 3.4.12.

### Packaging
- Bumped to 3.4.11 and rebuilt `.deb`.

# RDX Broadcast Control Center Changelog

## v3.4.11 (2025-10-24)
### Fixed
- JACK connect reliability: treat "already connected" and generic "cannot connect" as success when the connection already exists.

### Changed
- Jack Graph UI: removed on-tab dropdowns; Profiles are now managed via a dialog (Profiles‚Ä¶) and a Generate button.
- Clear visual state: each cable shows üîê when locked and ‚ö†Ô∏è when unlocked; right‚Äëclick menu disables Disconnect for locked cables.

### Added
- Generate Profile: proposes a VLC‚ÜíRivendell, Rivendell‚ÜíStereo Tool, Stereo Tool‚ÜíLiquidsoap, and Liquidsoap‚Üísystem chain based on detected ports; saves and optionally applies it.

### Packaging
- Bumped to 3.4.11 and rebuilt `.deb`.

## v3.4.10 (2025-10-24)
### Added
- JACK Profiles: Save current graph connections as a named profile; Apply/Delete from the Jack Graph tab. Profiles are stored at `~/.config/rdx/jack_profiles.json`.

### Changed
- Jack Graph layout polish: moved client and port labels outward so the middle stays clean; drag from left output ports to right input ports is now visually clear and uncluttered.

### Packaging
- Bumped to 3.4.10 and rebuilt `.deb`.

## v3.4.9 (2025-10-24)
### Fixed
- Jack Graph: Zoom In/Out now work with smooth scaling and preserved zoom after refresh.
- JACK port parsing: Eliminated ghost "Properties" ports; Rivendell inputs and physical/USB I/O show correctly.

### Added
- Manual Connect/Disconnect UI on the Jack Graph tab with editable Output/Input selectors and Lock/Unlock for protected pairs.

### Improved
- Auto-Connect enhanced to route VLC outputs to Rivendell inputs when available, alongside RD ‚Üí Stereo Tool ‚Üí Liquidsoap chain.

### Packaging
- Bumped to 3.4.9 and rebuilt `.deb`.

## v3.4.8 (2025-10-24)
### Changed
- Version bump to publish jackd dummy backend fix and hardened release notes flow.

### Notes
- Use the built-in publish script with `--from-changelog` to keep release notes concise and attach the .deb automatically.

## v3.4.7 (2025-10-24)
### Fixed
- jackd dummy backend: omit `-n` (nperiods) which is not supported by the dummy driver, preventing "Unknown option n" errors with jackdmp 1.9.20.

### Release
- Hardened release script so passing `--notes-file CHANGELOG.md` automatically extracts only this version's section (same behavior as `--from-changelog`). This avoids full-changelog recaps and keeps assets prominent.

### Packaging
- Rebuilt `.deb` as 3.4.7.

## v3.4.5 (2025-10-24)
### Fixed
- Ensured `JackMatrixTab` defines its own pretty helpers in-class: `_pretty_client`, `_pretty_port_name`. This avoids AttributeError during startup.

### Build Safety
- Builder guard now verifies those methods exist inside `JackMatrixTab` via AST and fails the build if missing. This prevents packaging scoping mistakes from shipping.

### Packaging
- Bumped to 3.4.5 and rebuilt the `.deb`.

## v3.4.6 (2025-10-24)
### Changed
- Respect JACK backend selection strictly. Removed automatic ALSA device selection to avoid switching users from Dummy to ALSA.
- If backend=ALSA and no device is set, Start now fails fast with a clear message instead of guessing a device.

### Diagnostics
- jackd logs are still written to `~/.config/rdx/jackd.log` when starting in jackd mode.

### Packaging
- Rebuilt as 3.4.6.

## v3.4.4 (2025-10-24)
### Changed
- Version bump and rebuild to roll up the latest hotfixes and keep package metadata aligned with in-app version strings.

### Packaging
- Rebuilt `.deb` as 3.4.4 and published.

## v3.4.3 (2025-10-24)
### Fixed
- Startup crash on some installs: `AttributeError: 'JackMatrixTab' object has no attribute 'refresh_jack_connections'`.
  - Moved the full set of JACK Patchboard (Matrix) methods back inside `JackMatrixTab` so they are defined before use.
  - This restores proper behavior for Refresh, per-port connect/disconnect, stereo pair connect/disconnect, Auto-Connect, and Emergency Disconnect.

### Packaging
- Version bumped to 3.4.3 to deliver the hotfix immediately.

## v3.4.1 (2025-10-23)
### Added
- JACK Graph (preview): New visual graph tab that shows JACK clients/ports as nodes and connections as edges.
  - Click an output port then an input port to connect.
  - Right-click an edge to Disconnect or Lock/Unlock (protect) the client‚Üíclient pair.
  - Shares protected pairs with the Patchboard via `~/.config/rdx/jack_protected.json`.
  - Includes Refresh, Auto-Connect, and Emergency Disconnect controls.

### Improved
- Fixed status bar initialization indentation to avoid class-scope execution; updated window title.

### Notes
- This is an initial, lightweight visualizer intended to complement the existing Patchboard. Future iterations will add draggable layout and per-edge persistence.

## v3.4.2 (2025-10-23)
### Fixed
- Hotfix: Restored protected-pairs persistence methods inside `JackMatrixTab` to prevent `AttributeError: 'JackMatrixTab' object has no attribute '_load_protected_pairs'` on startup.

### Packaging
- Bumped `.deb` to 3.4.2 so the fix is delivered immediately.

## v3.4.0 (2025-10-23)
### Added
- JACK jackdbus mode in Service Control: start/stop/restart via `jack_control`, with parameters applied using `ds/dps/eps`.
- ALSA device enumeration in JACK Settings: editable dropdown populated from `aplay -l`, plus a Refresh button.
- Presets in JACK Settings: "Live Low Latency", "Production Stable", and "Dummy (No HW)" apply typical backend/rate/period/nperiods/realtime setups.
- Adopt/Show Current: detects running JACK configuration (jackdbus via `jack_control`, or jackd command-line fallback) and fills the dialog or shows a summary.

### Improved
- Unified JACK start/stop helpers: both modes (jackd/jackdbus) route through consistent helpers with clearer error messages and status updates.

### Notes
- Visual graph-based patchboard is next. Current per-port manual patching remains available in the JACK tab and protected pairs behavior is unchanged.

## v3.3.5 (2025-10-23)
### Improved
- Build-time guard: Added an AST-based sanity check in the builder to detect any use of `self` at class scope (outside of methods). The builder will try a safe one-pass normalization for common mis-indents (status bar/title lines) and abort the build if violations remain. This prevents shipping packages that would crash with `NameError` at startup.

### Notes
- No functional UI changes; this release focuses on packaging resilience and preventing runtime class-scope errors from slipping through.

## v3.3.4 (2025-10-23)
### Fixed
- Hotfix: Resolved `NameError: name 'self' is not defined` during startup. A mis-indented status bar line ended up at class scope instead of inside `setup_ui()`. The line is now correctly indented so class creation no longer executes instance code.

### Packaging
- Rebuilt `.deb` as 3.3.4 to propagate the fix immediately.

## v3.3.3 (2025-10-23)
### Added
- Service Control: JACK Settings dialog. Configure backend (ALSA/Dummy), device, sample rate, frames/period, periods/buffer, realtime flag, and extra args. Settings are saved to `~/.config/rdx/jack_settings.json`.
- JACK management toggle: Choose whether RDX should manage the JACK server. When disabled, RDX won‚Äôt start/stop JACK and disables those buttons to avoid conflicts with Rivendell/QJackCtl.

### Improved
- Non-blocking status probes: All periodic checks for `jack_lsp`, `pgrep liquidsoap`, and `systemctl is-active` use short timeouts to prevent UI sluggishness if tools hang or respond slowly.
- Start All respects JACK management: only launches JACK if the RDX management toggle is enabled, then proceeds with Liquidsoap ‚Üí Stereo Tool ‚Üí Icecast.
- Safer JACK start/stop: starts jackd detached with your saved settings; stop also tries `jack_control exit` if available.

### Notes
- If Rivendell or QJackCtl already manages JACK on your system, keep the RDX JACK management toggle off to avoid double-management.
- ALSA device dropdown and jackdbus profiles are planned; current release focuses on a safe, minimal manager with solid UX.

## v3.3.2 (2025-10-23)
### Added
- JACK Patchboard: per-port manual patching controls. Select any specific output port and connect it to any input port, independently of L/R stereo pairing.

### Improved
- JACK routing UX: better L/R detection and ordering; recognizes more Stereo Tool client names (stereo_tool, stereotool, Stereo Tool). Clearer error feedback and an "already connected" tolerance.
- Emergency Disconnect uses safer checks when tearing down non-critical connections.
- Auto-Connect heuristics tuned to find ST and Liquidsoap more reliably.

### Build/Release Safety
- Packaging-time indentation guard broadened: any mis-indented method body lines in main UI classes are auto-normalized before packaging; build fails if still invalid.
- Pre-copy source compile check added (non-destructive). Optional flags:
  - RDX_FAIL_ON_SOURCE_SYNTAX=1 to hard-fail on source syntax errors
  - RDX_FIX_SOURCE=1 to opt-in source normalization with backup
- Atomic releases: new publisher supports --from-changelog to include only the relevant version section as notes.

### Notes
- This release focuses on JACK patching control and preventing future startup breaks due to indentation drift. Larger visual graphing (drag/drop) is on the roadmap.

## v3.3.1 (2025-10-23)
### Fixed
- Startup crash on fresh installs: corrected mis-indentation in `RDXBroadcastControlCenter.__init__` and a stray out-dented status bar line inside `setup_ui()`, which triggered `IndentationError: unexpected indent` on launch.

### Packaging
- Bumped builder to 3.3.1 and rebuilt the `.deb` so the fix is propagated. Update using the new package to permanently resolve the error.

## v3.3.0 (2025-10-23)
### Added
- JACK Patchboard: Replaced the old grid matrix with a simple, stereo-aware patchboard. Pick a Source (stereo out) and Destination (stereo in), then Connect L/R or Disconnect. Includes a quick ‚ÄúUnprotect current‚Äù action.
- Protected pairs persistence: Critical Source‚ÜíDestination pairs are now saved to `~/.config/rdx/jack_protected.json` and preserved across restarts. Emergency Disconnect keeps protected pairs intact.
- Settings tab: User-level autostart for RDX via `systemd --user` (install/enable/disable/start/stop/restart controls). Tray options including ‚ÄúMinimize to tray on close‚Äù and ‚ÄúHide to tray now‚Äù.
- System tray: Tray icon with Show/Hide and Quit menu; single-click toggles visibility.
- Stereo Tool ‚ÄúLatest URL‚Äù fallback: Optional field to store a curated or official stable link, and a button to download directly from it. Value persisted in `~/.config/rdx/settings.json`.

### Improved
- JACK UX: Clearer L/R semantics and less clutter versus the old matrix. Auto-Connect helper attempts RD ‚Üí Stereo Tool ‚Üí Liquidsoap and Liquidsoap ‚Üí system:playback when detected.

### Notes
- The Thimeo auto-parser remains available; if it doesn‚Äôt find artifacts on your system, the new ‚ÄúLatest URL‚Äù path provides a reliable one-shot alternative.
- AAC/FLAC deep-dives are still deferred; MP3/OGG/OPUS remain solid. We‚Äôll revisit FLAC edge cases separately.

## v3.2.31 (2025-10-23)
### Added
- Stereo Tool Manager tab: manage multiple Stereo Tool instances (add from URL/file, auto-download JACK x64 from Thimeo page), set active, start/stop.
- Per-user systemd unit: `rdx-stereotool-active.service` is generated under `~/.config/systemd/user` and points to the active instance via a symlink at `~/.config/rdx/processing/stereotool/active`.

### Improved
- Start order helper: ‚ÄúStart All Services‚Äù now sequences JACK ‚Üí Liquidsoap ‚Üí Stereo Tool ‚Üí Icecast with simple readiness checks.
- UI consistency: Icecast Management ‚ÄúGenerate/Prepare‚Äù buttons now match Stream Builder button sizing (min height + expanding width).

### Notes
- AAC/FLAC reliability work remains queued; current release focuses on Stereo Tool integration scaffolding.

## v3.2.30 (2025-10-23)
### Fixed
- FLAC streaming to Icecast now uses an Ogg container: `%ogg(%flac())` to prevent runtime failures.

### Improved
- Launcher PATH hardening: prepend `~/.local/bin` so the OPAM Liquidsoap shim is preferred by GUI launches.
- OPAM installer adds FFmpeg dev libs (`libswscale-dev`, `libavfilter-dev`) and performs a one-time rebuild if the FFmpeg encoder is still missing.
- Encoder detection continues to be capability-based and OPAM-aware; AAC prompts remain gated strictly to AAC configs.

### Packaging
- Builder updated to 3.2.30; rebuilt `.deb` with the above fixes.

## v3.2.29 (2025-10-23)
### Fixed
- UI Hotfix: Corrected remaining indentation in the Stream Builder actions row and main window setup that could crash on launch (IndentationError).

### Improved
- Post-OPAM messaging clarified when neither `fdkaac` nor FFmpeg AAC encoders are present: MP3/Opus/Vorbis/FLAC remain usable; AAC requires `libfdk-aac-dev` (for `%fdkaac`) or FFmpeg dev libs before OPAM build.
- Kept capability-based detection: AAC is only required if your generated config actually uses it; otherwise startup isn‚Äôt blocked.

### Packaging
- Rebuilt `.deb` with the hotfix and updated version metadata.

## v3.2.28 (2025-10-22)
### Added
- Service Control: compact encoder capability line (e.g., "Encoders: fdkaac, ffmpeg, mp3, opus"). It auto-refreshes after start/restart and hides itself if no encoders are detected to avoid UI clutter.
- OPAM installer: post-install verification that checks `liquidsoap --list-encoders` and, if `libfdk-aac-dev` is present but `encoder.fdkaac` is missing, performs a one-time `opam reinstall liquidsoap` to pick up FDK-AAC.

### Improved
- OPAM-aware detection and startup logic: capability-based checks (via `liquidsoap --list-encoders`/`--version`) instead of relying on apt package names.
- AAC is validated only when the generated config actually requests it. Either `fdkaac` or `ffmpeg` AAC satisfies AAC output; non-AAC streams are never blocked by AAC checks.
- Stream Builder AAC generation: prefer `%fdkaac` when available; fallback to `%ffmpeg` with explicit typing (`audio=true, video=false`) and sane defaults compatible with Liquidsoap 2.x.
- Unified logging: Liquidsoap log path is now `~/.config/rdx/liquidsoap.log` across generator and UI.
- OPAM installer ensures dev libs for MP3/Opus/Vorbis/FLAC/FFmpeg so other codecs continue to work out of the box when using OPAM.

### Fixed
- Fallback installer heredoc/redirect syntax error that occasionally broke non-interactive installs.

### Packaging
- Includes `/usr/share/rdx/install-liquidsoap-opam.sh` with the verify-and-rebuild step for FDK-AAC pickup.
- Builder bumped to 3.2.28 and `.deb` rebuilt and attached to the release.

## v3.2.27 (2025-10-22)
### Added
- In-app installer now offers a PPA-free option: "Build via OPAM" which compiles Liquidsoap per-user with AAC/FFmpeg support
- Live progress dialog for OPAM build; creates a user shim at `~/.local/bin/liquidsoap` so RDX can find the binary immediately

### Improved
- Fallback behavior: OPAM path bypasses broken PPA situations on jammy/noble and avoids adding focal sources

### Packaging
- Package now includes `/usr/share/rdx/install-liquidsoap-opam.sh`
- Builder bumped to 3.2.27

## v3.2.26 (2025-10-22)
### Fixed
- Hotfix: Resolved `IndentationError: unexpected indent` in Stream Builder actions block inside `setup_ui()`
- Affected v3.2.25 on some systems due to a mis-indented line; corrected and rebuilt

## v3.2.25 (2025-10-22)
### Improved
- Stream Builder: action buttons now match Icecast Management button sizing (consistent min height and expanding width)
- In-app FFmpeg plugin installer shows a live progress dialog (no more ‚Äúhung‚Äù feeling), streaming logs during installation

### Fixed
- Liquidsoap AAC generation prefers native `%fdkaac` when available; falls back to `%ffmpeg` AAC automatically

### Packaging
- Hardened FFmpeg plugin installer helper:
  - Enables `universe`/`multiverse`
  - Logs to `/var/log/rdx-plugin-install.log`
  - Robust fallback when `add-apt-repository` fails for `savonet/ppa` (manual source + key import), then retries install

## v3.2.24 (2025-10-22)
### Fixed
- Startup crash on some environments: "QWidget: Must construct a QApplication before a QWidget"
  - Moved all Stream Builder widget creation strictly inside `setup_ui()` so no widgets are created at import time
  - Ensures clean startup when launching via desktop shortcut or wrapper scripts

### Notes
- No functional changes beyond the crash fix; recommended upgrade for all users seeing the startup error

## v3.2.23 (2025-10-22)
### Improved
- Installer elevation: use `pkexec /bin/bash /usr/share/rdx/install-liquidsoap-plugin.sh` to avoid noexec/permission issues and eliminate sudo TTY errors
- Better error messages when PolicyKit is unavailable or the operation is canceled

### Packaging
- Rebuilt and published `.deb` with the updated installer invocation

## v3.2.22 (2025-10-22)
### Fixed
- Restored Stream Builder controls accidentally removed during refactor:
  - "Generate Liquidsoap Config" and "Apply to Icecast" buttons
  - Configuration Status area reinstated and grouped
- Fixed Streams table to include an "Actions" column (7 columns total) to avoid out-of-bounds cell widget placement

## v3.2.21 (2025-10-22)
### Added
- Launcher diagnostics: logs Python runtime version and the first 3 lines of the installed app script to aid remote troubleshooting of indentation/version mismatches

### Fixed
- Minor version string alignment

## v3.2.20 (2025-10-22)
### Fixed
- Finalize indentation normalization for main window init and UI setup to ensure consistent behavior when launched via desktop shortcuts across environments

### Packaging
- Rebuilt and published 3.2.20 to ensure the corrected script is propagated cleanly

## v3.2.19 (2025-10-22)
### Fixed
- Residual indentation errors after 3.2.18 cleanup: removed stray duplicated block after `start_service()` and repaired mis-indented lines in main window

### Notes
- No functional changes beyond syntax fixes; retains guided FFmpeg plugin installer and preflight sanitizers

## v3.2.18 (2025-10-22)
### Fixed
- Resolved Python SyntaxError/indentation issues introduced during installer integration
- Cleaned up Service Control logic: correct try/except scoping and removed duplicate code

### Added
- Proper `restart_service()` implementation in Service Control tab (user-process for Liquidsoap; systemd for others)

### Changed
- `start_service()` now uses `systemctl start` for non-user Liquidsoap services (was incorrectly using restart)
- Version strings aligned across title bar, status bar, and application metadata

### Notes
- Retains guided FFmpeg plugin installation and preflight parse/sanitizer flow

## v3.2.17 (2025-10-22)
### Added
- In-app one-click installer for Liquidsoap FFmpeg plugin with choices:
  - Current OS repos
  - Official Liquidsoap repo
  - Vendor repo (Paravel)
- Post-installation automation: attempts to install the FFmpeg plugin during package configure

### Improved
- Hardened plugin detection and user guidance when encoder plugin is missing
- Adaptive sanitizer and capability probe for FFmpeg encoders and formats

### Packaging
- Built and published `.deb` to `releases/` as v3.2.17

## v3.2.16 (2025-10-22)
### Fixed
- Installation compatibility: Relaxed FFmpeg plugin requirement to avoid ‚Äúdependency not satisfiable‚Äù on distros where that package name isn‚Äôt available

### Improved
- Preflight message now suggests alternative plugin packages: `liquidsoap-plugin-ffmpeg` | `liquidsoap-plugin-all` | `liquidsoap-plugin-extra`

### Packaging
- Depends: `liquidsoap (>= 2.0.0)`; Recommends include plugin alternatives
- Builder script bumped to 3.2.16 and rebuilt package

### Packaging
- Builder script bumped to 3.2.14 and rebuilt package

## v3.2.14 (2025-10-22)
### Fixed
- Hotfix: Moved status bar initialization inside `setup_ui()` and corrected `setWindowTitle` indentation in `__init__`
- Resolves NameError and IndentationError seen when launching from desktop shortcut

## v3.2.13 (2025-10-22)
### Fixed
- Hotfix: Resolved IndentationError in main window constructor (`__init__`) causing startup failure
- Version strings aligned across title bar, status bar, and application metadata

### Packaging
- Builder script version bumped to 3.2.13

## v3.2.12 (2025-10-22)
### Fixed
- Liquidsoap: eliminate NameError during Start by importing `re` at module scope
- Liquidsoap AAC typing: explicitly mark FFmpeg encoder as audio-only with `audio=true, video=false` to satisfy Liquidsoap 2.x type-checker

### Improved
- Auto-sanitizer now injects `audio=true, video=false` into `%ffmpeg(...)` when missing, quotes `audio_bitrate`, and removes `source=radio` label
- Installer template `radio.liq`: log path now `~/.config/rdx/liquidsoap.log` and includes a correct AAC example commented out

## v3.2.11 (2025-10-22)
### Fixed
- Liquidsoap: generator uses positional source (radio) again; removed unsupported source= label
- Auto-sanitize existing configs on start: quote ffmpeg audio_bitrate (e.g., 64k -> "64k"), replace source=radio

### Improved
- Preflight parse-check still runs; if it fails, the app attempts auto-fix then re-checks and shows any errors

## v3.2.10 (2025-10-22)
### Fixed
- Liquidsoap: pass stream source explicitly using `source=radio` in `output.icecast(...)` to resolve type mismatch errors in 2.x
- Update skeleton example (`radio.liq.example`) to use `source=radio`

## v3.2.9 (2025-10-22)
### Fixed
- Liquidsoap AAC config: quote ffmpeg audio_bitrate value (e.g., "64k") to fix parse error

### Improved
- Preflight: run `liquidsoap -c` to parse-check config before starting/restarting; show errors in-app

## v3.2.8 (2025-10-22)
### Fixed
- Liquidsoap AAC encoder config: replaced unsupported `%aac(...)` with widely-supported ffmpeg-based AAC encoder

### Packaging
- Recommend `liquidsoap-plugin-ffmpeg` to ensure AAC encoding availability by default

### Installer/Docs
- Installer now installs `liquidsoap-plugin-ffmpeg` by default on Debian/Ubuntu
- In-app guidance updated to suggest installing `liquidsoap-plugin-ffmpeg`

## v3.2.7 (2025-10-22)
### Changed
- Version bump to v3.2.7 and packaging refresh

### Docs
- Added/updated changelog entries for v3.2.4‚Äìv3.2.6

## v3.2.6 (2025-10-22)
### Fixed

## v3.2.3 (2025-10-22)
### Fixed
- **CRITICAL**: Fixed config directory permissions issue preventing stream loading
- **IMPROVED**: More robust ownership and permissions handling for `~/.config/rdx`
- **ENHANCED**: Better error messages with manual fix instructions for permission problems
- **ELIMINATED**: Fallback directories - exclusively uses `~/.config/rdx` with proper ownership

### Technical Improvements
- **Aggressive Permissions Fix**: Forces correct user:user ownership on config directories
- **Parent Directory Fix**: Ensures `.config` parent directory has correct ownership
- **Explicit Permissions**: Sets directory permissions to 755 explicitly
- **Better Error Recovery**: Provides clear manual fix commands when permissions fail
- **No Fallbacks**: Removed confusing fallback paths that caused ownership issues

### Permission Fix Details
- Forces creation of `~/.config/rdx` with correct user ownership
- Fixes parent `~/.config` directory ownership if needed
- Sets explicit 755 permissions on config directory
- Provides manual fix commands if automatic fixes fail

## v3.2.2 (2025-10-22)
### Fixed

- Fixed indentation issues from method refactoring
- Ensured clean Python syntax throughout codebase

## v3.2.1 (2025-10-22)
### Fixed
- **CRITICAL**: Fixed config directory fallback causing files to save in `~/.rdx` instead of `~/.config/rdx`
- **CRITICAL**: Fixed stream persistence between tabs using JSON storage instead of in-memory references
- **CRITICAL**: Eliminated config directory ownership confusion - no more root:root directories
- **IMPROVED**: Icecast Management now reads streams from persistent storage, not parent tab references
- **ENHANCED**: Forced use of standard config directory `~/.config/rdx` - no confusing fallbacks

### Major Technical Improvements
- **Persistent Stream Storage**: Streams saved to `~/.config/rdx/streams.json` and loaded consistently
- **Unified Config Path**: All config files now use `~/.config/rdx/` directory exclusively
- **Cross-Tab Communication**: Icecast Management reads from JSON storage, not runtime parent references
- **Proper Ownership**: Config directories created with correct user:user ownership from start
- **Error Prevention**: Eliminated fallback to `~/.rdx` that caused path confusion

### Fixed Workflow
1. **Stream Builder**: Add streams ‚Üí Auto-saved to `~/.config/rdx/streams.json`
2. **Icecast Management**: Reads streams from JSON storage ‚Üí Generates correct configs
3. **Deployment**: Creates configs in `~/.config/rdx/` with proper ownership
4. **Result**: Streams appear correctly in Icecast config with proper mount points

## v3.2.0 (2025-10-22)
