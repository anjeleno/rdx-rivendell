# RDX - Rivendell Extended

**Professional broadcast audio system with intelligent routing and advanced streaming capabilities**

RDX enhances Rivendell v4+ with **broadcast-grade intelligence**: smart hardware detection, automatic audio routing, bulletproof protection for critical connections, and comprehensive AAC+ streaming support. Critical broadcast audio is safe while gaining unprecedented control over complex routing scenarios.

## 🔥 v2.1.0 Enhanced Pro Features

**NEW in v2.1.0**: Professional AAC+ streaming with HE-AAC v1/v2 support, smart dependency management, enhanced packaging system, and **fully automated dependency installation**.

- **AAC+ Streaming Engine**: Professional-grade HE-AAC v1/v2 encoding with custom bitrate profiles
- **Smart Installer**: Automatic detection and installation of missing dependencies
- **Enhanced Packaging**: Complete .deb package with integrated streaming capabilities  
- **Automated Installation**: Zero-touch dependency resolution during package install
- **Professional Profiles**: Optimized settings for talk radio, music, and mixed content

Eliminates the guesswork out of integrating a comprehensive streaming and processing stack into Rivendell. Standards-based. Core functions of streaming and processing are managed directly from RDAdmin, eliminating the need to edit config files in the terminal. Adds native AES67 driver support to Rivendell.

Virtualizes and replaces expensive outboard gear used for remote broadcasts. Example: set up an Azuracast server as a remote-relay server. Use BUTT as a streaming source on-site at a live broadcast to connect to the relay server. Connect to the relay stream as an ordinary listener with VLC. VLC captures live audio and routes over Jack to the Rivendell record inputs to pass through live remote broadcast audio.## 🎯 Project Objective:

RDX extends Rivendell's core functionality with modular management of streaming, processing, rotuing of AES67, Jack aware applcations. With smart codec and stream buidling. Feels like a native Rivendell application, but safe to install/uninstall without disrupting mission critical audio. 

- **JACK Audio**: Profile-based management with device discovery and intelligent patchbay
- **Streaming**: Integrated Icecast configuration and Liquidsoap control
- **Processing**: Stereo Tool lifecycle management and auto-startup
- **Networking**: AES67 audio-over-IP integration with JACK bridging
- **System**: PulseAudio elimination for broadcast-clean audio paths

## 🏗️ Architecture

RDX follows the **Extension Package** approach for maximum compatibility:
