# rdx-darkice.cfg — DarkIce configuration template for RDX
# Notes:
# - JACK is used as the input; patch your stereo L/R into DarkIce in the RDX Jack Graph.
# - Leave jack auto-connect disabled and use RDX to patch cables for clarity and protection.
# - Set Icecast server credentials/mount to match your environment.
