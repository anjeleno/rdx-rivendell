# rdx-buttrc.sample — BUTT configuration template for RDX
# This is a minimal example. The exact buttrc format can vary by version.
# Recommended usage: Configure BUTT via its GUI once, enable "connect on startup",
# then copy the resulting ~/.buttrc here for reference or deployment.

# Notes:
# - Enable JACK input in BUTT settings so it creates JACK input ports.
# - Patch Stereo Tool L/R to BUTT L/R in the RDX Jack Graph.
# - For multiple streams/mounts, run multiple BUTT instances with different profiles.
