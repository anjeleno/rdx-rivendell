- ✅ **Permission Setup**: Configures audio group and user permissions
- ✅ **Service Configuration**: Enables systemd services appropriately
- ✅ **Environment Setup**: Creates aliases and shortcuts for rd user

### 🛠️ **Manual Override Options**

If you prefer manual control or encounter issues:

```bash
# Check what would be installed
sudo rdx-deps scan

# Install dependencies manually with interaction
sudo rdx-deps install

# Force install missing packages
sudo apt-get install -f

# Check installation status
rdx-deps check
```

### 🧠 **Smart Dependency Manager**

The `rdx-deps` command supports multiple operation modes:

```bash
# Automated modes (used by post-installation script)
rdx-deps scan                    # Show missing packages
rdx-deps install --auto-yes      # Install without prompts
rdx-deps check                   # Verify all dependencies

# Interactive modes (for manual use)
rdx-deps install                 # Install with user confirmation
rdx-deps rivendell               # Check Rivendell integration
rdx-deps audio                   # Check audio system status
rdx-deps streaming               # Check streaming tools
```

### 🔧 **Troubleshooting**

If automatic installation encounters issues:

```bash
# Check what happened
rdx-deps check

# View installation log
tail -f /tmp/rdx-install.log

# Manual dependency installation
sudo rdx-deps install --manual

# Force package configuration
sudo dpkg --configure rdx-rivendell-enhanced
```
